## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- tailwindCSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Building this project, I figured there are quite alot of things you can do with html anchor tag without needing JavScript to toggle between pages. I used the html anchor tag to link various pages together once clicked.

example below, linking a page to another with the anchor tag

```html
<a href="anotherPage.html"></a>
```
